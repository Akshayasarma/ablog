    <p> I like reading because it has stories to tell maybe that is joyful or a little bit gloomy books can also contain some information that happened<br>long ago maybe like about 14-19th centery Some thing i really like about books is that it contains some words that many or some people don't know<br>it is useful to know some of those words so when you are speaking of writing some paragraphs or any thing it could be said or writen shorter
